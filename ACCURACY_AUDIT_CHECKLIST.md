# Accuracy Audit Checklist for Rules Engine

**Purpose**: Ensure 100% accuracy of deadline calculations - critical for legal defensibility

---

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before adding any new jurisdiction rule, complete this checklist:

### 1. Primary Source Verification ✅
- [ ] Verified answer deadline from official state/federal rules
- [ ] Checked current version (not outdated statute)
- [ ] Confirmed effective date of rule
- [ ] Documented rule citations (e.g., "FRCP 12(a)", "CCP § 412.20")

**Sources to use**:
- ✅ Cornell Legal Information Institute (https://www.law.cornell.edu/)
- ✅ Official state supreme court websites
- ✅ Official court rules repositories
- ❌ DO NOT use: Wikipedia, legal blogs, commercial sites without verification

### 2. Answer Deadline Verification ✅
- [ ] Confirmed number of days (15-45 day range expected)
- [ ] Cross-checked against `DEADLINE_CALCULATIONS_REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Verified if days are calendar days or business days
- [ ] Documented any conditional logic (e.g., NY 20 vs 30 days)

### 3. Service Extension Verification ✅
- [ ] Confirmed service method extensions (mail, email, etc.)
- [ ] Verified extension amount (+3, +5, +10 days)
- [ ] Checked if extensions apply to all service methods or specific ones
- [ ] Verified states with NO extension (Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey)
- [ ] Documented unique extensions (California +5/+10, Florida +5 mail/email)

### 4. Special Rules Verification ✅
- [ ] Checked for unique procedural rules (Texas Monday Rule, NY conditional)
- [ ] Verified if different deadlines apply to different defendant types
- [ ] Confirmed U.S. government defendant exceptions (Federal 21 vs 60 days)
- [ ] Documented any state-specific terminology ("petition" vs "complaint", "demurrer" vs "motion to dismiss")

---

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing the rule in code:

### 5. Rule Schema Accuracy ✅
- [ ] `offset_days`: Matches verified deadline (15-45)
- [ ] `offset_direction`: Always "after" for answer deadlines
- [ ] `priority`: Set to "FATAL" for answer deadlines
- [ ] `applicable_rule`: Correct citation format
- [ ] `add_service_days`: Boolean matches service extension rules
  - `True` if state adds 3+ days for mail
  - `False` if state has NO extension (GA, LA, NJ)
- [ ] `calculation_method`: Set to "calendar_days"
- [ ] `notes`: Clearly explains extension rules

### 6. Conditional Logic (if applicable) ✅
- [ ] Conditions array properly structured
- [ ] Multiple deadlines for different scenarios
- [ ] Each deadline has unique `id`
- [ ] Conditions match verified rules (e.g., NY 20 personal vs 30 mail)

### 7. Metadata Accuracy ✅
- [ ] `name`: Follows format "Answer to [Complaint/Petition] - [State] Civil"
- [ ] `description`: Concise, accurate summary
- [ ] `effective_date`: Current rule version date
- [ ] `citations`: Array of official rule citations
- [ ] `jurisdiction_type`: "state" or "federal"
- [ ] `state`: Correct 2-letter abbreviation
- [ ] `court_level`: Correct (circuit, district, superior, etc.)

### 8. Tags Accuracy ✅
- [ ] Includes state name (lowercase)
- [ ] Includes "civil"
- [ ] Includes rule set abbreviation (e.g., "frcivp", "ccp", "trcp")
- [ ] Includes "answer"
- [ ] Includes document type ("complaint", "petition", "summons")

---

## Post-Implementation Testing Checklist

After implementing a new rule:

### 9. Code Review ✅
- [ ] No hardcoded values (all in schema)
- [ ] Function name follows pattern: `create_[state]_complaint_served_rule`
- [ ] Slug follows pattern: `[state]-civil-answer-to-complaint`
- [ ] Jurisdiction follows pattern: `[state]_civil`
- [ ] All required imports present

### 10. Cross-Reference Check ✅
- [ ] Rule matches entry in `DEADLINE_CALCULATIONS_REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Any discrepancies documented and researched
- [ ] Reference doc updated if errors found

### 11. Test Scenarios ✅
Test each rule with these scenarios:

#### Personal Service Test
- Service date: 2026-01-20
- Service method: personal
- Expected: Base deadline only (no extension)

#### Mail Service Test
- Service date: 2026-01-20
- Service method: mail
- Expected: Base deadline + mail extension days

#### Edge Case Tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Conditional logic (NY personal vs mail)
- [ ] Different defendant types (Federal individual vs government)
- [ ] Unique rules (Texas Monday Rule)
- [ ] States with NO extension (Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey)

### 12. Documentation Updates ✅
- [ ] Main seed script includes new function call
- [ ] Coverage count updated in main() output
- [ ] `JURISDICTION_COVERAGE.md` updated
- [ ] `RUN_WHEN_HOME.md` updated
- [ ] `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` updated (if applicable)

## Audit Frequency

### When to Audit:
1. **Before each new state addition** - Pre-implementation checklist
2. **After every 5 states** - Full audit of recent additions
3. **Quarterly** - Review all rules for law changes
4. **When rules are questioned** - Immediate verification

### Audit Process:
1. Select states to audit
2. Run through verification checklist items #1-4
3. Check implementation against checklist items #5-8
4. Run test scenarios from item #11
5. Document any discrepancies found
6. Fix immediately if inaccurate
7. Update reference docs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG: Assuming all states have mail extensions
**Reality**: Georgia, Louisiana, and New Jersey have NO mail service extension
**Fix**: Always verify `add_service_days` boolean against reference

### ❌ WRONG: Using outdated rule versions
**Reality**: States update civil procedure rules periodically
**Fix**: Always check effective dates and current versions

### ❌ WRONG: Mixing up "petition" vs "complaint" terminology
**Reality**: Some states use "petition" (TX, MO, OK), others use "complaint"
**Fix**: Use correct terminology in rule name and metadata

### ❌ WRONG: Forgetting conditional logic for special cases
**Reality**: NY has 20 vs 30 days, Federal has 21 vs 60 days
**Fix**: Implement multiple deadline objects with conditions array

### ❌ WRONG: Hardcoding extensions in offset_days
**Reality**: Extensions should be handled by `add_service_days` boolean
**Fix**: offset_days = base deadline only, extensions added automatically

### ❌ WRONG: Trusting secondary sources without verification
**Reality**: Legal blogs and commercial sites may have errors
**Fix**: Always verify against primary sources (Cornell LII, state court sites)
