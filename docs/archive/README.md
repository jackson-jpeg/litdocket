## Why These Were Archived

1. **Seeding docs:** Database is now seeded (confirmed 14 jurisdictions)
2. **Status docs:** Information is outdated (Jan 10-26, 2026)
3. **Planning docs:** Useful historical context, but not current implementation docs

## What to Keep in Root

The project root now contains only current, essential documentation:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `DATABASE_SEEDED_CONFIRMATION.md` - Current seeding status
- `SCRIPTS_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Recent scripts cleanup
- `UPDATED_RULES_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Current architecture

## If You Need Historical Context

These archived docs contain valuable information about:
- Original jurisdiction expansion plans (52 jurisdictions planned)
- Detailed state-by-state deadline calculations
- UX design vision
- Historical debugging and fixes

They're preserved here for reference but are not current implementation guides.
